"""Adaptive router: decide fast hybrid vs. PathRAG vs. both.

Heuristic, explainable, and deterministic (ADR-0008). Signals:
* relational/multi-hop language ("between", "compare", "relationship", "both", …)
* multiple distinct entities present in the query
* how many of those entities exist in the knowledge graph
* query length / question structure

Returns a :class:`RouteDecision` with the route, confidence and a human-readable
rationale, which is surfaced in the trace panel. An optional LLM classifier can be
layered behind the same interface later; the heuristic is the $0 default.
