# Running Auralynq

Two ways to run: **containers (Podman)** for a full production-shaped stack, or
**local CLI/dev** at $0. Below covers both, plus deploying to a **different
machine**. Podman only — no Docker, no sudo required.

---

## TL;DR (this server)

The stack is normally already running. Otherwise:

```bash
cd /home/mhamdan/Auralynq
make stack-up      # start;  make stack-down to stop
```

Open **https://<your-server-ip>:8443** (accept the one-time self-signed cert warning).

### Fixed IP + custom ports (`make start` / `make stop`)

To run on **<your-server-ip>** with a custom port range (2002, 2004–2010 — 2003 is
skipped as reserved), use the convenience targets backed by
`scripts/run_local.sh`:

```bash
make start     # → https://<your-server-ip>:2002   (Caddy TLS, the browser URL)
make stop      # stop everything
make restart   # stop + start
make status    # container status
```

Port plan (only **2002** is published on the network; the rest stay on host
loopback): `2002` HTTPS · `2004` web · `2005` api · `2006/2007` qdrant ·
`2008` mcp · `2009/2010` phoenix. Edit the values at the top of
`scripts/run_local.sh` to change them. These are exported into the environment
(podman-compose gives them precedence over `.env`), so your secrets in `.env`
are read but never modified.

---

## 1. Run on a DIFFERENT machine

The whole stack is three published images on GHCR (public) plus a small `.env`.
You do **not** need the source to run it — only `compose.yml`, the `Caddyfile`,
and an `.env`.

### Prerequisites on the new machine
- **Podman** + a Podman Compose (`podman compose` *or* `podman-compose`).
- Ports: open inbound **TCP `<HTTPS_PORT>`** (default 8443) in the firewall. No
  other port needs to be public.
- No GHCR login needed — the images are public.

### Step 1 — get the deploy files
Clone the repo (or copy just `compose.yml`, `containers/Caddyfile`,
`scripts/`, `Makefile`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MHHamdan/Auralynq.git && cd Auralynq
```

### Step 2 — create `.env` (git-ignored; never commit it)
Replace `<SERVER>` with the new machine's IP **or** domain, and set your keys
(all optional — missing keys degrade to offline fallbacks):

```bash
cat > .env <<'EOF'
# --- where browsers reach it ---
AURALYNQ_HTTPS_PORT=8443
AURALYNQ_CERT_HOST=<SERVER>                       # IP or domain (cert SAN)
AURALYNQ_SITE_ADDRESS=:8443                       # or https://your.domain (Let's Encrypt)
AURALYNQ_SERVE__CORS_ORIGINS=["https://<SERVER>:8443"]
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=/api                         # browser → same-origin proxy
AURALYNQ_BIND_INTERNAL=127.0.0.1                  # internal services off the public NIC

# --- run the PUBLISHED images from GHCR (no local build needed) ---
AURALYNQ_IMAGE_PREFIX=ghcr.io/mhhamdan/auralynq-
AURALYNQ_IMAGE_TAG=0.1.0

# --- providers (all optional; degrade to local fallbacks) ---
AURALYNQ_LLM__PROVIDER=cohere                     # or: auto | ollama | extractive
COHERE_API_KEY=...                                # your key(s)
# OPENAI_API_KEY= / ANTHROPIC_API_KEY= / HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=

# --- API auth (recommended when public). Empty = open ---
AURALYNQ_SERVE__API_KEY=<openssl rand -hex 24>
EOF
```

### Step 3 — start
```bash
make stack-up
```
Browse to **https://<SERVER>:8443**.

### Step 4 — add data
- **UI**: the Ingest panel → upload a PDF/DOCX/TXT/audio.
- **CLI**:
  ```bash
  podman cp mydoc.pdf auralynq-api:/app/data/corpus/
  podman exec auralynq-api auralynq index --input /app/data/corpus
  ```

### The one gotcha: TLS cert on a new host
The Caddy image bakes a **self-signed cert** whose SAN is `AURALYNQ_CERT_HOST`.
The GHCR `auralynq-caddy` image was built with `localhost`, so on a new IP the
browser shows a cert warning (functionally fine — click *Advanced → Proceed*).
For a clean cert, pick one:

- **Self-signed for your IP** — rebuild just caddy locally (needs the repo):
  ```bash
  AURALYNQ_CERT_HOST=<SERVER> podman build -t auralynq-caddy:0.1.0 \
    -f containers/caddy.Dockerfile .
  # then drop AURALYNQ_IMAGE_PREFIX for caddy, or retag/push your own
  ```
- **Trusted (real domain)** — set `AURALYNQ_SITE_ADDRESS=https://your.domain`
  and `AURALYNQ_TLS=internal`; Caddy auto-provisions Let's Encrypt (needs the
  domain's DNS → this host and ports 80/443 reachable).

### Rootless networking note
On hosts where rootless Podman's CNI lacks container DNS, `make stack-up`
auto-patches the network conflist (CNI 0.4.0 + dnsname) — no sudo. If you use a
working Docker/Podman 4 + netavark host, service-name DNS works out of the box and
this is a no-op.

## 1b. Laptop = full stack + all your APIs, server as automatic backup

Run the complete Podman stack on your laptop with your own provider keys, and have
the UI **transparently fail over to the remote server** when the laptop's own API
is down (ADR-0020). Because it's your laptop, `localhost` works in the browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MHHamdan/Auralynq.git && cd Auralynq

cat > .env <<'EOF'
# --- browser reaches the laptop locally ---
AURALYNQ_HTTPS_PORT=8443
AURALYNQ_CERT_HOST=localhost
AURALYNQ_SITE_ADDRESS=:8443
AURALYNQ_SERVE__CORS_ORIGINS=["https://localhost:8443"]
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=/api
AURALYNQ_BIND_INTERNAL=127.0.0.1

# --- all your providers (real keys) ---
AURALYNQ_LLM__PROVIDER=cohere
COHERE_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=hf_...
AURALYNQ_RERANK__PROVIDER=auto          # uses Cohere rerank when COHERE_API_KEY is set

# --- API auth for the laptop's own API (any value; server re-injects its own) ---
AURALYNQ_SERVE__API_KEY=...

# --- automatic failover to the server backup ---
AURALYNQ_API_FALLBACK=https://<your-server-ip>:8443/api
AURALYNQ_API_FALLBACK_INSECURE_TLS=1    # server uses a self-signed cert
AURALYNQ_API_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT_MS=12000   # time-to-first-byte before failing over
EOF

make stack-up        # build + start the 7-service stack locally
```

Open **https://localhost:8443**. Every request hits the laptop's API first; if that
container is down or wedged, the proxy replays the request against the server and
answers anyway — no URL change, streaming and auth preserved.

**Verify failover works:**
```bash
# normal: served locally
curl -sk -D- -o/dev/null -X POST https://localhost:8443/api/query \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"question":"hi"}' | grep -i x-auralynq-upstream
#   x-auralynq-upstream: primary

podman stop auralynq-api          # simulate the laptop backend going down
curl -sk -D- -o/dev/null -X POST https://localhost:8443/api/query \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"question":"hi"}' | grep -i x-auralynq-upstream
#   x-auralynq-upstream: fallback   <-- answered by the server

podman start auralynq-api         # back to local
```

> The `x-auralynq-upstream` response header (`primary` | `fallback` | `none`) tells
> you which backend served any request. Failover triggers on a connection
> error/timeout or a 502/503/504 — never on a 4xx/500, so real app errors aren't masked.
>
> Notes: the failover replays the request body, so it buffers POST bodies in the web
> container (fine for queries; large ingests use more memory). The laptop's
> `AURALYNQ_SERVE__API_KEY` need not match the server's — the fallback goes through
> the server's `/api` proxy, which overwrites it with the server's own key.

## 2. Full production stack on THIS machine (from source)

```bash
cd /home/mhamdan/Auralynq
make images          # build api/web/caddy locally (versioned + OCI labels)
make stack-up        # start; make stack-down to stop; make stack-logs to tail
```

`make stack-up` starts: **caddy** (public TLS) + web + api + mcp + worker + qdrant
+ phoenix. Only the HTTPS port is public; everything else binds loopback.

After changing code, rebuild then **fully cycle** (podman-compose pins image IDs):
```bash
make images
podman-compose -f compose.yml down && make stack-up
```

---

## 3. Local CLI / dev ($0, no containers)

```bash
make setup                 # uv venv + light deps
make data && make index    # sample corpus → index
make demo                  # end-to-end: typed + voice, prints cited answers
auralynq ask "How does PathRAG prune relational paths?"
auralynq serve             # FastAPI on :8000
auralynq-mcp               # MCP server over stdio (Claude Desktop, IDEs)
```

---

## URLs & ports

| Service | URL | Public? |
|---------|-----|---------|
| **Web UI** | `https://<SERVER>:8443` | ✅ (only this) |
| API docs | `https://<SERVER>:8443/api/docs` | via proxy |
| Phoenix traces | `http://127.0.0.1:6006` | loopback (SSH-tunnel to view) |
| Qdrant / API / MCP | loopback only | ❌ internal |

## Health checks

```bash
podman ps
curl -sk https://<SERVER>:8443/api/health
curl -sk -X POST https://<SERVER>:8443/api/query \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"question":"hi"}'
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Cert warning** — expected with self-signed; *Advanced → Proceed*, or use a domain.
- **502 right after `make stack-up`** — web is still booting; retry in a few seconds.
- **No answer in chat after a code change** — rebuild the web image and **fully
  cycle** (`down` then `make stack-up`); hard-refresh the browser (Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-R).
- **Can't reach from another machine** — open inbound TCP 8443 in the firewall.
- **Secrets** live only in `.env` (git-ignored). Never commit it.
