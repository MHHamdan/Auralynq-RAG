<One paragraph: what this Space demonstrates and who it's for.>

## What this demo does

<Concrete capabilities a visitor can try: chat, citations, visual grounding
click-through, ModelFit page, etc.>

## What data is stored, and for how long

- **Persistence:** <ephemeral (wiped on restart) | persistent `/data`
  attached>. Be explicit — a public Space with no persistent storage loses
  everything on restart.
- **Uploads:** <disabled | enabled>. If enabled on a public Space, warn that
  anyone can add documents others can query, and that they persist only as
  long as the container runs (unless persistent storage is attached).
- **Third parties:** <none | which provider APIs receive data if keys are set>

## Configuration — Variables vs. Secrets

- **Variables** (visible in Space settings): `AURALYNQ_DEMO_MODE`,
  `AURALYNQ_ALLOW_UPLOADS`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`, … — never a key/token.
- **Secrets** (encrypted): `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  `COHERE_API_KEY`, `AURALYNQ_SERVE__API_KEY`, `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`.

Full list with safe defaults:
[`deploy/huggingface/env.example`](https://github.com/MHHamdan/Auralynq-RAG/blob/main/deploy/huggingface/env.example).

## How to duplicate

Click **Duplicate this Space**. Variables carry over; **Secrets do not** —
you'll re-enter your own keys, so you never inherit the original operator's.

## Hardware recommendations

- **Default:** CPU basic — the lightweight demo needs no GPU.
- **GPU:** only worth it if you've also configured a real embedding/LLM
  provider; document the tier once you have real ModelFit numbers for it.

## Limitations

<Offline extractive answering verifies the pipeline not answer quality; CPU
only; single demo corpus; no persistence; etc. — be honest.>
